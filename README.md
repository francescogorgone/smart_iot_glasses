## Problem adresse

In the world, 253 million people live with visual impairments, of which 36 million are completely blind (Lancet Global Heart, 2017). The inability or limited capacity to orient oneself visually poses a significant challenge for many individuals worldwide. These individuals are often compelled to rely on a companion to alert them to potential dangers, or at the very least, to use a traditional aid such as a white cane.

# Objective

The aim of this project is to assist visually impaired individuals in navigating their environment by developing a system that enhances their safety during movement. By using a wearable device—such as a pair of glasses—it is possible to receive audio notifications about objects encountered along the way without the need for a companion or conventional aid.
